# Email configuration
Email is key to ingest new information into the system. 

The general workflow works as follows:
- An edition is created for a specific town or group of towns
- An email alias is created for the edition (e.g. east-windsor@...) (manual step)
- The email is subscribed to various local newsletters and announcements (manual step)
- As emails arrive they are processed and associated with the edition

Our email is set up as follows:
- IMAP email account with runbox.com
- Email aliases are + based (e.g. some-email+eastwindsor@run.com)
